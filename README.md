Hello,
I have used super store data and creates some of the visulizations using the pivot table and charts.
Some of them are:
1) Shippment mode VS Sum of Profit
2) State wise Quantity and Sum
3) Profit gained in Different states
4) Sum of Sales and Discounts
5) Sum of Profit with respect to States (Using the Map)

Thanks for having the time for looking at my work
